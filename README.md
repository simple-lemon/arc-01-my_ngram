# Description
This program is designed to count the occurrences of each character in a given text string. It takes a text string as input, iterates through each character in the string, and increments the corresponding count in an array. Finally, it prints out the counts of each character in the text string.
# Task
 There are some tasks of this program. 
 Text Analysis: Understanding the frequency of different characters in a text can provide insights into the language used, patterns of writing, or even identify specific characters or symbols that occur frequently.
Data Processing: In data processing tasks, character occurrences can be vital for tasks such as text compression, encryption, or even data validation.
Error Checking: Analyzing the occurrences of characters can help in error detection and correction, especially in fields like data transmission or data entry.
# Usage
The main utility of this project lies in its ability to analyze and provide statistics on the distribution of characters within a text. 
# Installition
Compile the Program: Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, with GCC. Run the Program: Execute the compiled program with the text string as a command-line argument.
