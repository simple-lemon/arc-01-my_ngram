# Welcome to my Ngram

## Task 
The task of this project is to implement an N-gram algorithm. The challenge lies in correctly counting the occurrences of each n-gram in a given text

## Description
The problem is solved by breaking down the text into n-grams and counting the frequency of each n-gram. The program takes command-line arguments and processes them to create the n-grams. It then counts the occurrences of each n-gram and displays the result

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:

> Clone the repository: git clone <```repository-url```>

> Navigate to the project directory: cd <```project-directory```>

> Compile the source code: gcc -o my_project main.c

> Run the program: ./my_project argument1 argument2

## Usage
The program takes command-line arguments and generates n-grams based on the given arguments. It then counts the occurrences of each n-gram and displays the result.

Example usage: ./my_project argument1
