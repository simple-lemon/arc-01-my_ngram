# MyNgram
calculate sentence probability with n-gram
# Descriprion
"
The N-Gram Project in C is a simple implementation of n-gram analysis, a technique used to extract and examine contiguous sequences of items (usually words) from a given text. This project provides a basic framework for understanding and implementing n-gram analysis, allowing users to explore the local linguistic patterns within a text.
"
# Task
"
The primary task of this project is to analyze a text and generate n-grams of a specified size. In the context of this implementation, n-grams refer to consecutive sequences of words in the input text. The project aims to facilitate a straightforward exploration of n-grams, enabling users to observe patterns and relationships within the provided textual data.
"
## Usage
"
The program takes command-line arguments and generates n-grams based on the given arguments. It then counts the occurrences of each n-gram and displays the result.
