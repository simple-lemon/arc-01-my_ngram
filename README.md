## Welcome to [My Ngram]

## Task
Write a C program to count the occurrences of characters in command-line arguments.

## Description
This C program takes command-line arguments and counts the occurrences of each character in those arguments. It stores the counts in an array and then prints out the characters along with their respective counts.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply compile the C code using a C compiler such as GCC.

## Usage
To use the program, run the compiled executable with command-line arguments. Each argument will be processed separately, and the program will count the occurrences of characters in each argument.
```
./count_characters hello world
```
