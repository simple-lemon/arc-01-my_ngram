## Task

- [x] You will need to create a folder and in this folder will be additional files containing your work.
- [x] Folder names must start with special file names and also contain (Makefile - _.c - _.h).
- [x] An n-gram must take 1 or more strings as an argument.
- [x] It should show one per line, each character and the number of occurrences.
- [x] Order must be alphanumeric.

## Description

N-grams are sequences of n elements in a given sample of text or speech. This program allows you to specify the size of an N-gram (N) and enter the desired text. N-grams are usually collected from a text or speech corpus. If the elements are words, n-grams can also be called shingles.

## Installation

1. Install a C compiler such as GCC.
2. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/darmanovjakhongir/arc-01-my_ngram`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using `cd arc-01-my_ngram`.
4. Build the project using `make`.
5. Run the following command to compile the program `gcc my_ngram.c -o my_ngram`.
6. Now you can run the program using the following command `./my_ngram`.

## Usage

1. Run the compiled program using `./my_ngram_project`.
2. Enter the size of N-grams (N) when prompted.
3. Enter the desired input text when prompted.
4. The program will then display a list of N-grams along with their frequencies in the text.
