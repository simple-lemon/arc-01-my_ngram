# Welcome to my_ngram

## Task
Your task is to implement a program in C that analyzes input strings and counts the occurrences of each character in the input.

## Description
The provided code contains functions to count the occurrences of characters in the input strings and print the counts for each character. You need to ensure that the program handles command-line arguments correctly, counts occurrences accurately, and displays the results properly.

## Installation
To install the program, follow these steps:
1. Copy the provided C code into a file named `my_ngram.c`.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler. For example, you can use GCC with the following command:
   ```
   gcc -o my_ngram my_ngram.c
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./my_ngram [string1] [string2] ...
   ```

## Usage
Once the program is running, provide one or more strings as command-line arguments. The program will analyze each input string and print the counts of occurrences for each character.

Example usage:
```
./my_ngram hello world
```

This would analyze the strings "hello" and "world" and print the counts of occurrences for each character in both strings.

Enjoy using my_ngram!
