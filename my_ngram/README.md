# Welcome to My Ngram
***QWASAR My Ngram***

## Task
Remember to git add && git commit && git push each exercise!
We will execute your function with our test(s), please DO NOT PROVIDE ANY TEST(S) in your file
For each exercise, you will have to create a folder and in this folder, you will have additional files that contain your work. Folder names are provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit directory and specific file names for each exercise are also provided at the beginning of each exercise under submit file(s).

## Description
In computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus. When the items are words, n-grams may also be called shingles.
Google Inc. has used this technique to improve the completion of its Search Engine. The program was developed by Jon Orwant and Will Brockman and released in mid-December 2010.
My Ngram will take 1 or multiple strings as arguments.
It will display, one per line, each character and the numbers of times it appears.
Order will be alphanumerical.
